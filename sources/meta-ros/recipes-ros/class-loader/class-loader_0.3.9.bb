DESCRIPTION = "The class_loader package is a ROS-independent package for loading plugins \
during runtime and the foundation of the higher level ROS "pluginlib" library. \
class_loader utilizes the host operating system's runtime loader to open \
runtime libraries (e.g. .so/.dll files), introspect the library for exported \
plugin classes, and allows users to instantiate objects of said exported \
classes without the explicit declaration (i.e. header file) for those classes."
